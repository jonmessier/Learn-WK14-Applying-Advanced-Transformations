## The Data 

You will be working with a heavily modified version of the Superheroes dataset from Kaggle.

The dataset includes two csv's:

- `superhero_info.csv` : Contains Name, Publisher, Demographic Info, and Body measurements.

- `superhero_powers.csv`: Contains Hero name and list of powers
---
## The Task

Your task is two-fold:

### I. Clean the files and combine them into one final DataFrame.

- This dataframe should have the following columns:
    - Hero (Just the name of the Hero)
    - Publisher
    - Gender
    - Eye color
    - Race
    - Hair color
    - Height (numeric)
    - Skin color
    - Alignment
    - Weight (numeric)
    - Plus, one-hot-encoded columns for every power that appears in the dataset. E.g.:
      - Agility
      - Flight
      - Superspeed
      - etc.

Hint: There is a space in "100 kg" or "52.5 cm"


### II. Use your combined DataFrame to answer the following questions.

-  Compare the average weight of super powers who have Super Speed to those who do not.
- What is the average height of heroes for each publisher?
